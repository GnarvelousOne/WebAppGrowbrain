This is an old version of the Gnarvelous Growbrain intended to be run as a web app.  The current version lives on a raspberry pi and will soon replace this repository

scale.py is pretty useful, it was the original standalone file used to control a watering hose when I had 100 plants to water and each one needed 30 seconds of water.  It exists still on the current RPi version of the Growbrain
